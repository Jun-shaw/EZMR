\title{Calculate mendelian randomization.}
\usage{
calculate_MR(
  exposure.id = NA,
  folder.path = "",
  Pfilter = 5e-08,
  kb = 10000,
  r2 = 0.001,
  outcome.id = "",
  outcome.name = "",
  valid = TRUE,
  valid.threshold = 0.05
)
}
\arguments{
\item{exposure.id}{Acquire the GWAS project ID from the website https://gwas.mrcieu.ac.uk/.}

\item{folder.path}{This parameter typically refers to the path to the folder where data files are stored.}

\item{Pfilter}{P-value filtering threshold, used to select significant SNPs. Only SNPs with P-values below this threshold are considered significantly associated.}

\item{kb}{Kilobases, which may define the window size for analysis in the genome, often used in assessing associations of nearby SNPs.}

\item{r2}{This represents the degree of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between SNPs, typically used to evaluate the correlation between SNPs. An rÂ² value closer to 1 indicates a stronger association between two SNPs.}

\item{outcome.id}{Acquire the GWAS project ID from the website https://gwas.mrcieu.ac.uk/.}

\item{outcome.name}{The name of the outcome factor.}

\item{valid}{This parameter is a logical variable that determines whether to conduct sensitivity validation.}

\item{valid.threshold}{This parameter sets the significance threshold for sensitivity analysis.
